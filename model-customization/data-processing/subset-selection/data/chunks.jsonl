A Fumble is any act, other than passing, successful handing, or legally kicking the ball, which results in a loss of player possession. It is not a fumble if the player immediately regains control of the ball. The use of the term Fumble always means that the ball was in possession of a player when the act occurred (8-7-3).\nNote: An intentional fumble that causes the ball to go forward is a forward pass and may be illegal (8-1-1-Pen. a-c).\nARTICLE 6.
