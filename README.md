## Purpose

This repository aims to be an informative and useful resource for AI model customization. It provides:

* **Modular Jupyter Notebook examples:** Covering individual steps in the model customization pipeline.
* **End-to-End (E2E) flows:** Demonstrating complete workflows, from data preparation to deployment.
* **Real-world use cases:** Showcasing practical applications of AI model customization.

The goal is to enable users, especially beginners, to quickly get started, understand complex concepts, and adapt examples for their own needs.

## Why This Structure?

This repository's structure is designed to maximize usability, clarity, and maintainability, drawing from established best practices in open-source projects. Key principles driving this organization include:

* **Guided Learning Paths:** A clear, sequential flow helps users, especially beginners, navigate content and progress from foundational concepts to advanced applications. This aligns with the "Progressive Learning Path" outlined in internal initiatives.
* **Modular & Focused Content:** Examples are organized into logical categories (e.g., core components vs. full pipelines) to help users quickly find specific tasks or understand distinct functionalities.
* **Real-World Applicability:** Dedicated sections highlight practical, industry-specific use cases, demonstrating direct value and application.
* **Reproducibility & Consistency:** The structure promotes standardized notebook development and facilitates the inclusion of necessary helper scripts and data, ensuring examples are easy to run and verify.

This thoughtful organization aims to provide an intuitive experience, making it easier to discover, utilize, and contribute to the repository.

## Quick Start

### Run in Google Colab (No Setup Required)

Want to play with these notebooks online without having to install anything?

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/instructlab/examples/blob/main/00_getting-started/02_hello-instructlab/01_first_customization.ipynb) *(Recommended)*

<p style="padding-left: 20px;">
<b>âš  Important Note:</b> Colab provides a temporary environment. Any changes you make or data you upload will be deleted after the session ends, so ensure you download any work or data you care about.
</p>

Just want to quickly look at some notebooks without executing any code?

You can use [GitHub's built-in notebook viewer](https://github.com/instructlab/examples/blob/main/00_getting-started/02_hello-instructlab/01_first_customization.ipynb). However, be aware that it can be slower, may not always display math equations correctly, and large notebooks sometimes fail to open.

### Run Locally (EXAMPLE FLOW!!!!)

To get started with the InstructLab examples and run them on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/instructlab/examples.git](https://github.com/instructlab/examples.git)
    cd instructlab/examples
    ```

2.  **Set Up Your Python Environment:**
    * It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment (e.g., `conda` or `venv`) for dependency management.
    * Install core Python packages required by Jupyter and common data science tasks:
        ```bash
        # Create and activate a virtual environment (example using venv)
        python -m venv .venv
        source .venv/bin/activate 

        # Install Jupyter Lab and other common dependencies
        pip install jupyterlab matplotlib numpy pandas scikit-learn
        ```

3.  **Install InstructLab:**
    * Instructions for installing the core InstructLab framework. This will depend on the official InstructLab installation method (e.g., `pip install instructlab` if it's a pip package, or cloning its repo and installing from source).
    ```bash
    # Example: If InstructLab is available via pip
    pip install instructlab
    ```
4.  **Prepare Local LLM Runtime (if examples use local models):**
    * If your examples leverage local Large Language Models (LLMs) via Ollama, ensure it's installed and running.
    ```bash
    # Install Ollama (if not already installed)
    # [Provide link to Ollama installation instructions]

    # Start Ollama service (if not running)
    ollama serve & # Runs in background
    ```
    * For specific examples that require a particular model, pull that model:
    ```bash
    # Example: For an example using Llama 3
    ollama pull llama3
    ```
    *(Note: Mentioning `ollama pull llama3` here is for examples that specifically use it, not a universal requirement unless all examples do).*

5.  **Launch Jupyter Lab:**
    ```bash
    jupyter lab
    ```
    * Your web browser will open to the Jupyter Lab interface, showing the repository's contents.

6.  **Run Your First Example:**
    * Navigate to the `00_getting-started/` directory.
    * Open `02_hello-instructlab/01_first_customization.ipynb` (or similar initial notebook).
    * Follow the step-by-step instructions within the notebook to run your first model customization example.

* If you're new, start with the **`00_getting-started/`** notebooks.
* If you want to understand a specific technique (like LoRA fine-tuning), explore **`01_model-customization/`**.
* If you're looking for a complete solution for a particular industry or use case, check out the **`02_end-to-end-flows/`**.

**Q: My notebook isn't running, or I'm getting an error. What should I do?**
A:
* First, ensure you've followed all steps in the "Getting Started" section, especially regarding environment setup and LLM runtime (e.g., Ollama).
* Check the specific notebook for any additional prerequisites or unique setup instructions.
