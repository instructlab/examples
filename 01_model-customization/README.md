# 01: Model Customization Examples

Welcome to the `Model Customization` section!

This directory is dedicated to providing **modular, deep-dive examples** of specific techniques and components used in AI model customization. Here, you'll find the foundational building blocks and detailed showcases for various aspects of the customization process. This section directly houses "Model Customization Component Deep-Dive Showcase Notebooks".

The goal of these examples is to help you:
* Understand core concepts (like taxonomies and data formats).
* Explore different fine-tuning methods.
* Learn how to evaluate your customized models.
* Perform local model serving and inference.

## Content Overview

This section is organized to guide you through the key components of model customization:

* `fundamentals/`: (Covers core concepts like understanding taxonomies and data formats)
* `data-ingestion-to-seed/`: (This is where `instructlab_knowledge.ipynb` would live, as it's a key pipeline *for* customization, following fundamentals)
* `fine-tuning-techniques/`: (Fine-tuning is a priority here)
* `evaluation/`: (Notebooks on how to evaluate customized models)
* `model-serving-and-inference/`: (Examples for local model serving and inference optimization)

## Getting Started in this Section

To begin exploring these modular examples, navigate into the sub-directories above based on the specific customization component you wish to learn about. Each directory typically contains notebooks to guide you through a sequential understanding of the topic.
