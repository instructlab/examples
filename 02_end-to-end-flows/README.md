# 02: End-to-End Flows

Welcome to the `End-to-End Flows` section!

This directory is designed to showcase complete, industry-specific pipelines that demonstrate the full AI/ML lifecycle within Jupyter. These examples highlight real-world use cases and are specifically crafted to illustrate the seamless transition from local development to enterprise-scale deployments.

The goal of these flows is to help you:
* Understand how individual model customization components can be combined into a full solution.
* See practical applications across various industries.
* Learn patterns for scaling AI/ML workflows from a local environment to a cluster.
