# UX Tools

Welcome to the `_ux-tools` directory!

This section of the repository contains tools and assets specifically designed to assist with the User Experience (UX) review and quality assurance of notebooks within this repository.

The primary purpose here is to:
* **Ensure Consistency:** Help maintain a high standard of UX across all examples by automating aspects of the review process.
* **Streamline Feedback:** Provide structured feedback on notebook clarity, usability, and adherence to best practices.
* **Facilitate Collaboration:** Offer tools that can be integrated into the contribution workflow for early UX checks.

## Content Overview

You will find the primary tool for notebook review here:

* **`ux-notebook-reviewer/`**: This directory contains the interactive Jupyter Notebook (`ux_notebook_reviewer.ipynb`) designed to automate UX reviews of other notebooks. It will typically include:
    * The main reviewer notebook.
    * Any associated templates or configuration files for the UX checklist (e.g., `ux_review_template.md`).
