# Utility Scripts and Helper Functions

Welcome to the `_utils` directory!

This section of the repository is dedicated to housing **reusable Python scripts, modules, and helper functions**. These utilities are designed to be imported and used across various examples and notebooks within the repository.

The primary purpose of centralizing these utilities is to:
* **Promote Code Reusability:** Avoid duplicating common code snippets across multiple notebooks.
* **Enhance Maintainability:** Make it easier to update and manage shared logic from a single source.
* **Improve Notebook Clarity:** Keep individual example notebooks cleaner, more focused, and easier to read by abstracting common functions.

## Content Overview

You will typically find the following types of assets in this directory:

* **Common Data Loaders:** Functions for loading and preprocessing datasets used by multiple examples.
* **Evaluation Helpers:** Standardized functions for calculating and presenting metrics.
* **Configuration Utilities:** Scripts for managing shared configurations or parameters.
* **Framework Integrations:** Helper functions for interacting with specific aspects of the InstructLab framework or other libraries.

## How to Use

To use a utility from this directory in your notebook, simply import the necessary functions or classes as you would with any other Python module.
