# 00: Getting Started Examples

Welcome to the `Getting Started` section of the InstructLab Examples Repository!

This section is designed to provide you with the quickest and simplest path to understanding and running your very first AI model customization examples using the framework. It establishes a foundational learning path for beginners.

Our goal here is to help you:
* Set up your environment efficiently.
* Run a basic model customization example.
* Understand the absolute core concepts of getting started with the framework.

## Content Overview

Here's what you'll find in this directory:

* **`01_setup-environment/`**: Contains instructions and notebooks to help you set up your local development environment with all necessary prerequisites for the examples.
* **`02_hello-instructlab/`**: Your "Hello World" equivalent. A minimal, basic example demonstrating the simplest possible model customization.
* **`03_basic-cli-workflow/`**: (Optional, if applicable) If the framework has a command-line interface, this section will guide you through basic CLI commands for interaction.

## Your First Steps

After cloning the main repository and following the overall "Quick Start / Getting Started" instructions in the [main README.md](../README.md), navigate into this directory and start with the `01_setup-environment/` notebook or instructions.

Remember, the aim is to get you up and running quickly so you can start experimenting!
