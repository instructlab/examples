    "### What is a Contribution?\n",
    "\n",
    "To add knowledge to a model, a user groups source documents of that contain the knowledge into knowledge contributions. A knowledge contribution is made up of:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. One or more PDF documents that can be described by a contribution summary.\n",
    "2. A contribution summary.\n",
    "3. A contribution domain.\n",
    "4. A unique name used to create a directory in the workspace for artifacts created by each step for the contribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once contributions are set up a user can go through the data pre-processing workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Contribution Summary?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the synthetic data generation step, a model (known as the teacher model) generates synthetic data based on the source document.\n",
    "The contribution summary and domain are used in the prompts that are sent to the teacher model to create data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The document gets broken up into [chunks](#Chunking), and each chunk is in the prompt sent to the teacher model.\n",
    "The contribution summary provides additional context to each chunk of a source document ensuring the teacher model has necessary background information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Contribution summaries should be specific, avoid acronyms or other vague references, and the represent the documents focus areas.\n",
    "When a contribution includes many versions of the same document, publication dates, volume numbers, or any other identifiers to distinguish between versions should be included in the contribution summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of a contribution summary from a recent paper on [inference-time scaling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.01618):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"A Probabilistic Inference Approach to Inference-Time Scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs)\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the title of the paper does a good job summaraizing the paper, the summary is based off the title but with the acronym LLM spelled out. \n",
    "\n",
    "Usually contributions only have one document. Contributions with multiple documents happen when the subject matter and format are similar among a group of documents. \n",
    "\n",
    "An example of a contribution having multiple documents would be the desire to teach a model an organization's bylaws over the years 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, with a different PDF for each year.\n",
    "\n",
    "A contribution summary in this case might look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Bylaws of organization Foo from 2021 - 2024`\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case that there was only one source document from the year 2023, the contribution summary would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "`2023 Bylaws of organization Foo`\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example of having multiple documents within the same contribution would be if the documents had the same format. An example here could be grouping together a furniture company's instruction manuals. The format and layout of the instruction manuals would be the same across different pieces of furniture, but each manual covers different furniture.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Furniture company Foo's assembly instructions for tables, desks, and nightstands`\n",
    "\n",
    "If the contribution only contained a PDF for the assembly instructions for an oak dining table the summary would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Assembly instructions for furniture company Foo's oak dining table`\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Contribution Domain?\n",
    "\n",
    "A contribution's domain is the overarching subject or scope of the source document(s). The domain provides critical context to guide the teacher model in generating synthetic data that is relevant and grounded.\n",
    "\n",
    "The domain is brief and should not exceed 3 words, but should ideally be 1-2 words.\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine the domain, users should review document's primary subject and identify the main topic or purpose of the document.\n",
    "Consider the intended use of the document and align it with the use case or audience. E.g. a tech manual for developers might fall under the “software development” domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the contribution summary examples discussed in the previous sections, domains could be `Artificial Intelligence Research`, `Bylaws`, and `Furniture Assembly`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Different contributions can have the same domain"
